# I.IIRE<sup>®</sup>: Intelligent Interactive Research Environment.


## About
<b>∞</b>, Infinite is a next generation intelligent interactive environment for the new generation of science to deal with any research activity at some capacity for the smart scientist. Infinite is build for <b>1)</b> intelligent molecule storage environment, <b>2)</b> intelligent interactive reaction environment, <b>3)</b> intelligent spots reaction environment, and <b>4)</b> intelligent array reaction environment. All of geared with the state-of-the-art design and specifications with laboratory protocol(s) to deal with not limited to store and doing the reactions with respect to time, also smart scientist now have capability at some capacity to handle more to out some brilliant research to solve the discovery, invention, and innovations; because also you can create the giant leap.

### Nomenclature of Infinite

<b>∞</b>.IIRE, have nomenclature, please go from here:

<b>(1)</b> Intelligent Molecule Storage Environment

i) <b>∞<sup>Ψ</sup></b> - Nascent Intelligent Molecule Storage Environment

ii) <b>∞<sup>Ψ.[1<1>]</sup></b> - α Intelligent Molecule Storage Environment

iii) <b>∞<sup>Ψ.[1<2>]</sup></b> - β Intelligent Molecule Storage Environment

iv) <b>∞<sup>Ψ.[1<4>]</sup></b> - δ Intelligent Molecule Storage Environment

v) <b>∞<sup>Ψ.[1<9>]</sup></b> - ι Intelligent Molecule Storage Environment

<b>(2)</b> Intelligent Interactive Reaction Environment

i) <b>∞<sup>Ω</sup></b> - Nascent infinite reaction environment

ii) <b>∞<sup>Ω.Ti.22</sup></b> - Titanium Infinite Reaction Environment

iii) <b>∞<sup>Ω.Cu.29</sup></b> - Copper Infinite Reaction Environment

iv) <b>∞<sup>Ω.Ag.47</sup></b> - Silver Infinite Reaction Environment

v) <b>∞<sup>Ω.Au.79</sup></b> - Gold Infinite Reaction Environment

(3) Intelligent Spots Reaction Environment,

i) <b>∞<sup>λ</sup></b> - Nascent infinite spots reaction environment

   if we have types of spotsarrays included, it would be below defined:
   
      DNA spotsarray,
      
      RNA spotsarray,
      
      Protein spotsarray,
      
      Tissue spotsarray,
      
      Cellular spotsarrays (also called transfection spotsarray),
      
      Chemical compound spotsarrays,
      
      Antibody spotsarrays,
      
      Carbohydrate spotsarrays,
      
      Phenotype spotsarrays.

(4) Intelligent Array Reaction Environment

i) <b>∞<sup>φ</sup></b> - Nascent infinite array reaction environment

      if we have types of microarrays included, it would be below defined:
      
- <b>∞<sup>φ.ζ</sup></b> - gene expression microarrays, and
      
- <b>∞<sup>φ.ξ</sup></b> - genome expression microarrays.

These above are the <b>∞</b> naming principle of our Intelligent Interactive Research Environment to deal with future sciences.
