# I.IIRE<sup>®</sup>: Intelligent Interactive Reaction(s) Environment.


## About
<b>∞</b>, Infinite is a next generation intelligent interactive environment for the new generation of science to deal with any research activity at some capacity for the smart scientist. Infinite is build for 1) intelligent molecule storage environment, and 2) intelligent reaction environment. Both of geared with the state-of-the-art design and specifications with laboratory protocol(s) to deal with not limited to store and doing the reactions with respect to time, also smart scientist now have capability at some capacity to handle more to out some brilliant research to solve the discovery, invention, and innovations; because also you can create the giant leap.
