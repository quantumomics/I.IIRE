# Introduction
Microarray or microarrays, the major experimental instrument in the assessment of gene expression via cDNA or RNA analysis; however, they are also used to be in screening libraries of proteins, carbohydrates and small molecules.
Microarrays are to help to extract deeper information from smaller sample volumes and enabled the incorporation of low cost high throughput detection of cancer, knowledge discovery, and assays in the finally drug discovery process.
